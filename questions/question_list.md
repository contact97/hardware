**Question:** Input is 7-bit binary number. Output the amount of “1”s present. For ex. for the inputs 1100110 and 1001110 the result should be the same and equal to 100 (4 in binary). Can use only Full Adders. Describe the circuit with minimum amount of parts.

**Answer:** 4 full-adder units are necessary to count the amount of “1”s in a 7-bit vector.

The most important thing to notice is that a full-adder “counts” the amount of “1”s of it’s inputs. If you are not convinced , then a brief look in the component’s truth table will prove this to you. The output is a binary represented 2-bit number.

The next picture shows how to connect the four full-adders in the desired way. The first stage generates two 2-bit numbers, each represents the amount of “1”s among its respected three input bits. The second stage adds those two binary numbers together and uses the carry_in of one full-adder for the 7th bit.

**Question:** Write verilog code for D flop and D latch.

**Answer:**

```verilog

// D Latch with active-low reset

module d_latch
(
    input  wire d   , // 1-bit input pin for data
    input  wire en  , // 1-bit input pin for enabling the latch
    input  wire rstn, // 1-bit input pin for active-low reset
    output reg  q     // 1-bit output pin for data output
);

// This always bock is "always" triggered whenever en/rstn/d changes
// If reset is asserted then output will be zero
// Else as long as enable is high, output q follows input d

always @(en or rstn or d)
begin
    if(!rstn)   begin q <= 0; end
    else if(en) begin q <= d; end
end

```

```verilog

// D Flip-Flop with synchronous active-low reset

module dff
(
    input  wire d   ,
    input  wire rstn,
    input  wire clk ,
    output reg  q
);

always @(posedge clk)
begin
    if(!rstn) begin q <= 0; end
    else      begin q <= d; end
end

```

```verilog

// D Flip-Flop with asynchronous active-low reset

module dff
(
    input  wire d   ,
    input  wire rstn,
    input  wire clk ,
    output reg  q
);

always @(posedge clk or negedge rstn)
begin
    if(!rstn) begin q <= 0; end
    else      begin q <= d; end
end

```

##

**Question:** To delay 10bit value to 10 clocks, how many flops are needed

**Answer:**

##

**Question:** Discuss the difference between Big-Endian and Little-Endian.

**Answer:** In computing, endianness is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory. Endianness is primarily expressed as big-endian (BE) or little-endian (LE). A big-endian system stores the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte at the largest. A little-endian system, in contrast, stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address.
